## Ebay Scraper

This is a repository for project 03, scraping from ebay 

This is the [link](https://github.com/mikeizbicki/cmc-csci040/tree/2022fall/project_03) to the project instructions. 

This `ebay-dl.py` file contians the `name` of ebay items. It also contains the `price` of these items. Some other tags include:`free returns`, `items sold`, `status`, and `shipping`. 

The program uses `argparse`, `requests`, `Beautiful Soup`, and `json`. 

## Files Generated 

I generated 3 different json files (pens.json, toys.json and water_park.json)
